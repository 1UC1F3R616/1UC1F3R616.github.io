I started coding in year 2018, that is my Sem 1 of college. Before that I only had some very introductory knowledge about coding. I am adding how my sem wise journey has been so far w.r.t learning how to code

**Sem 1 (July-Nov 2018)**: I focused on competitve coding and started following a few seniors who were good at dev and cp. Build a strong HackerRank Profile. Python was my first Prog. Language and most used also, others were C, C++, Java.

**Sem 2 (Dec-April 2018)**: Build a lot many projects, excelled myself in Web Scraping and Desktop Application using Tkinter (yes it was a wrong choice, lmao). Also had some intro with Web Dev.

**Sem 3 (July-Nov 2019)**: I lost myself entirely from July to Oct, it was a period of great depression xD than everything changed with GitHub Hacktoberfest20219. It came as a blessing for me and my GitHub Activity Timelines says the same.

**Sem 4 (Dec-April 2019)**: I joined *DSC-VIT* and this really did helped me in many ways, like working in a team with like minded people and seeing internally how events are organized. I execlled my Backend skills in this period, starting from Flask then to  Django, FastAPI, NodeJS. In March2020 things changed and holidays were declared :0

**Danger Notice:** A few people may feel attacked by reading this, it's in best interest of them to have a self introspection before engaging their worst.

**Sem 5 (July-Nov 2019)**: I always been interested in Hacking, Infact I had a whatsapp group filled completely where I use to share Tips and Tricks about Hacking in my first sem of college itself xD (disbanded after 5 months). I learnt a lot about Recon, Bug Bounty, Hacking, Pentesting, CTFs and much more stuff related to Cyber Security. I also joined *CSI-VIT CTF* Team that has a best rank of number 8 in India, pretty amazing people here and a great learning environment. I left DSC-VIT because of the politics played by a few two-faced people and poor atitude by those in new power, had some bad time in accepting the truth but good friends are always their to help out :J
My other focus in this sem was on the DevOps, so I build a few projects that had CI/CD, Lambda Functions, and other DevSecOps tools and utilities being used.
